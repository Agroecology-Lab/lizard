# Lizard

Lizard is a domain-specific language to define hardware behaviour. 
It is intened to run on embedded systems which are connected to motor controllers, sensors etc. 
Most of the time it is used in combination with a higher level engine like ROS or RoSys. 
You can think of the microcontroller as the machines lizard brain which ensures basic safety and performs all time critical actions.

## Features

- Shell-like input/output over serial to ease the development.
- Quick and ressource efficient execution on embedded hardware.
- Safety conditions are checked continously with realtime guarantees.
- Human-readable and easy to type (like bash).
- As short as possible to ensure quick transmission and interpretation.
- Arguments use SI base units if possible.

## Language overview

Message
: any text which is send to the microcontroller over serial

Output
: the text which is send from a module over serial

Module
: the internal representation for an piece of hardware which has commands, settings, configurations and triggers

Command
: a message which is send to an module

Setting
: a message which changes the behaviour of a module

Configuration
: messages which are stored persitently and executed after boot to initialize the system

Trigger
: a kind of variable through which a module reflects its hardware state

Conditions
: regulary checked statements which check a trigger for a certain type to execute a command
