# Pinout

Please refer to the GPIO table for your Robot Brain’s pinout configuration.

There are two kinds of pins:

- ESP pins are referred to by their GPIO number, e.g. “14”.
- Additional pins are available via an internal MCP23017 port expander and are referred to with the prefix “MCP_”, e.g. “MCP_A3”.
